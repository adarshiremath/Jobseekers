# Abstract

The job outlook growth in recent years has been growing constantly as per the market requirements. Specifically in the areas of those where there is a higher necessity of specialized, trained and skilled professionals. Students are often not aware of all the fields available in the IT industry. Most students don’t explore the various fields and just follow the norm which all the other students follow. Students must pursue the job of their liking based on their interests and skills. It is often noticed that freshers are not able to bag a job even after 6-7 months of completing their education. Some of the reasons why this happens is listed below:

**Confused** – Most of the freshers are not sure which career option to choose or they don’t know themselves, what kind of job they want and end up going for wrong job interviews.

**Keep preparing for Government jobs** – Many of them keep preparing for government jobs for years and then realise it is not meant for them, but till then they have lost many months and lose track of industry trends.  

**Resume is full of mistakes** – They do not make a proper resume and share a resume full of mistakes which makes them get screened out in the resume screening phase itself.

**They don’t know themselves** – They do not do proper SWOT analysis before going for a job interview.

**Miss on making the first impression** – They do not know how to dress for an interview and miss on making a good first impression with the recruiter.

**Lack communication skills** - These days most of the jobs need basic English writing as well as verbal communication skills but most of the students do not focus much on their communication all through and find it difficult to comprehend during an interview process.

**Do not practice giving interviews** – Freshers do not practice giving mock interviews and are not well prepared to face a real interview and lose confidence in front of the interview panel or when asked tricky questions.

**Do not invest time in research** – They do not do proper research about the job or know what is the salary bracket for the job that they have applied for and end up asking for a very high salary which makes them lose the game.

**Do not have the right attitude** - Freshers today have that strange attitude that makes it difficult for them, first to land a job and even if they get it they find it difficult to sustain for long.

So, these are some of the reasons why freshers find it difficult to find a job. I will keep sharing more such blogs here especially to help our freshers learn and start to earn soon. Share this blog with your friends who are finding it difficult to get a job, so that they do not make these mistakes and are well prepared for their next interview.

While there are a lot of platforms available on the internet, not all of them have the factor of personalization. There are a lot of fields with a lot of scope in itself, it is important for students to identify their interests and prospective career options through the 4 years of their engineering. 

Keeping the above points in mind, we have developed a web application to identify the different jobs available in the market catered to the students interests.
